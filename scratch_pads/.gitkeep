# Scratch Pads Directory

This directory is for temporary planning documents and thoughts during issue development.

Each issue should have its own scratchpad file named: `issue-{number}-{brief-description}.md`

Example: `issue-123-user-authentication-plan.md`

## Purpose
- Document your thinking process for complex issues
- Link to relevant GitHub issues and PRs  
- Break down implementation approaches
- Record decisions and trade-offs considered
- Store research findings and code snippets

## Cleanup
Scratch pads can be deleted after the issue is completed and merged, or kept for reference on complex features.
