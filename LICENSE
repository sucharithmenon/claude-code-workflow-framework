This framework is inspired by and builds upon:

1. **GitHub Flow** - Created by Scott Chacon (GitHub co-founder) in 2010
   - Original workflow methodology for git-based development
   - https://github.com/schacon

2. **Greg + Code Methodology** - AI development workflow demonstration
   - Original video: "The Claude Code & GitHub WORKFLOW to Build Complex Apps"
   - YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@gregcode

3. **Claude Code** - AI-assisted development platform by Anthropic
   - https://claude.ai/code

The Claude Code Workflow Framework (CCWF) adapts these proven methodologies
specifically for AI-assisted development workflows.
